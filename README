Scans for BIN auctions sold significantly below their average value and attempts to purchase those items

AuctionScanner.py:
	Scans all BIN auctions, collects their sell prices and item types into a file. 
	This should be run for at least a few days before using the rest of the program.
	
AuctionScout.py:
	Constantly scans new BIN auctions for prices significantly below their means
	(which come from AuctionScanner.py). Once a deal is found, the /viewauction
	command is copied to clipboard and pyautogui is used to execute the command in the game.
	
autoAuctionPurchase.js:
	A LiquidBounce 1.8.9 script that detects auction house purchase prompts and sends packets
	confirming the item's purchase
	
Use Instructions: WARNING: This is only a POC and should not be run with malicious intent
	1. 	Run AuctionScanner.py on some sort of device that can stay on 24/7
	
	2. 	Pipe the output file (ahData.json) to the same folder as AuctionScout.py.
		Right now, I have auctionscout trying to grab the file over the internet from a local IP.
	
	3.	Adjust the pyautogui.moveTo method call to the confirm button when attempting to buy on 
		the auction house
	
	4.	Add autoAuctionPurchase.js to the scripts folder in LiquidBounce
	
	5.	Head in game and setup some sort of anti-afk method
	
	6.	Purchase a booster cookie to use the /viewauction command
	
	7.	Enable the autoAuctionPurchase and run AuctionScout.py
